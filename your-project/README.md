## Project Description
Tic Tac Toe is a classic. Two players play in a board of 3x3 and the first one to have 3 marks in a row wins. I chose this game because it's a game you can play anywhere without needing cards, computers or boards.

## Rules
-Board must be 3x3
-Player 1 is “X” and Player 2 is “O”
-First to get 3 in a row wins (horizontally, vertically or diagonally)
-Game tied if 9 squares are full and there are no 3 marks in a row.


## Workflow

Firstly I created a dasboard in trello and organized my tasks. When coding I realized that I was aiming to high and re-wrote most of my code. Finally, I created the presentation to show the game.

## Organization

I used trello in order to have all my tasks organized and sorted by stages.
